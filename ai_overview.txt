AI & Machine Learning Overview
================================

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence
in machines. AI systems can perform tasks such as reasoning, learning,
problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn from data
without being explicitly programmed. Key types include:
  - Supervised Learning: learns from labeled data (e.g. spam detection)
  - Unsupervised Learning: finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g. clustering)
  - Reinforcement Learning: learns through rewards & penalties (e.g. game AI)

What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning uses multi-layer neural networks to model complex patterns.
It powers image recognition, speech synthesis, and large language models.

Key Applications:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP): chatbots, translation, summarisation
  - Computer Vision: face recognition, medical imaging
  - Recommendation Systems: Netflix, Spotify, Amazon
  - Autonomous Vehicles: self-driving cars, drones
